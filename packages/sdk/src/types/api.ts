   * Some considerations to keep in mind
   *
   * - Due to the complex nature of monitoring off-chain liquidity across multiple marketplaces, including dealing with block re-orgs, events should be considered 'relative' to the perspective of the indexer, ie _when they were discovered_, rather than _when they happened_. A more deterministic historical record of price changes is in development, but in the meantime, this method is sufficent for keeping an external system in sync with the best available prices.
   *
   * - Events are only generated if the best price changes. So if a new order or sale happens without changing the best price, no event is generated. This is more common with 1155 tokens, which have multiple owners and more depth. For this reason, if you need sales data, use the Sales API.
