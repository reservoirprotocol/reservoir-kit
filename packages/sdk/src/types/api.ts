   * Every time the floor price of a collection changes (i.e. the 'floor ask'), an event is generated. This API is designed to be polled at high frequency, in order to keep an external system in sync with accurate prices for any token.

   *
   * - `new-order` > new listing at a lower price
   *
   * - `expiry` > the previous best listing expired
   *
   * - `sale` > the previous best listing was filled
